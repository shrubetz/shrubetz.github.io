<p>Sarah Hrubetz

<p>I am currently working as a technical consultant at Nextec Group. In my position, I make modifications to Sage EM ERP software. 
I graduated from Clarion University with a dual major in mathematics
and computer science, and successful completion of the honors program. In my spare time I am exploring various coding projects, such as modding games
updating old projects, and furthering my understanding of my undergraduate courses.</p>
